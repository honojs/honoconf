# How to Hold a Hono Conference

This document explains how to hold a Hono Conference.

This document is a guideline for people who want to organize a Hono Conference. Its purpose is to help Hono Conferences happen in many places by using this as a reference.

This repository (`github.com/honojs/honoconf`) exists **only to provide guidelines**. Websites, logos, operation materials, or code for your own Hono Conference are **not managed** in this repository, nor in any repository under `github.com/honojs`. Please prepare and manage those independently for each conference.

## What is Hono Conference?

Hono Conference is a **community-driven conference** centered around Hono. Anyone can organize one, anywhere.

Maintainers who develop Hono itself in `github.com/honojs`, and their organizations, are **not involved in organizing** Hono Conference (there is no official or certified Hono Conference).

## Overview

- Anyone can organize a Hono Conference
- No prior permission or approval is required
- It is similar to a franchise in concept, but there is **no central authority or headquarters**
- If the local community agrees, that is enough to hold one
- Any size is acceptable, but **100+ participants** is preferred
  - As a guideline, events with fewer than 100 participants are often called meetups
- Hono Conference is basically intended to be held **in person**
- Logos and websites should be created freely by each organizer

## Purpose

The purpose of Hono Conference is to create opportunities for:

- Interaction between users and contributors
- Interaction among users
- Interaction among contributors

Any other goals or purposes should be **defined freely by each conference**.

## Naming

Please use the following format when naming your conference:

```plain
Hono Conference in <City> <Year>
```

### Examples

- Hono Conference in Tokyo 2026
- Hono Conference in San Francisco 2026

The abbreviation **HonoConf** should be used.

## Organizers

Each Hono Conference is **organized independently**.

Hono maintainers such as @yusukebe and @usualoma, as well as the organizations involved in developing Hono itself under `github.com/honojs`, do **not** participate in organizing Hono Conferences.

All planning, operations, and decisions are the responsibility of each organizer.

## Logo & Branding

Please **do not use the official Hono logo as the main logo of your event**.

We recommend creating your own logo and visual identity for each conference. Using the official Hono logo in explanatory or supplementary contexts is acceptable.

## Code of Conduct

All Hono Conferences must, at a minimum, follow the **Hono Code of Conduct**:

- https://github.com/honojs/hono/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Each conference may adopt a stricter Code of Conduct if desired.

## Tips for Organizing

- Keeping photos and writing reports helps future organizers
- You may collect sponsors
- A mix of users and contributors makes for a healthy event
- The following track structure works well:
  - User track
  - Deep / advanced track
- Using a CFP (Call for Proposals) is recommended
- Runtime and platform are not restricted
- Forming an organizing committee can be helpful
- Volunteers on the event day make operations smoother

## What Makes It “Hono-like”

Hono Conference values the following ideas:

- No restriction on runtime or platform
- Anyone can organize
